# Home Assistant Netgear Integration

The `Netgear` [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) integration is a completely local (no cloud) integration that allows you to integrate your Netgear WAX access points into Home Assistant. Today this integration supports the WAX device models but is coded to make it easy to add other devices in the future.

Supports turning on WI-FI SSIDs. This is particular useful if you want to automate turning on your guest WI-FI network.

## Installation

### HACS install

To install with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/):
1. Click on HACS in the Home Assistant menu
1. Click on Integrations
1. Click the EXPLORE & ADD REPOSITORIES button
1. Search for `Netgear`
1. Click the INSTALL THIS REPOSITORY IN HACS button
1. Restart Home Assistant
Configure the access point by going to Configurations -> Integrations -> ADD INTERATIONS button, search for Netgear and configure the device.

### Manual install

To manually install:

```bash

$ mv netgear_wax-main/custom_components/netgear_wax <home-assistant-install-directory>/config/custom_components/
```

> :warning: **After executing one of the above installation methods, restart Home Assistant. Also clear your browser cache before proceeding to the next step, as the integration may not be visible otherwise.**

# Known supported devices

* WAX-610
* WAX-620
* WAX-630
* WAC-510
* Probably the other WA* devices but I haven't tested them

Please let me know if you've tested with additional devices

# Known issues
* Toggling wifi on/off taks about 25 seconds. During that time the switch in the UI may toggle to the original setting until the underlying call completes on the API. There's no harm but just a jaring user experience that needs to be worked out.
